I thought, “This woman will probably bail on me—I’m not great at talking.” But you turned out to be so kind and understanding toward me. We had our share of awkward conversations, and we didn’t always see eye to eye. Yet somehow, we managed to become friends— and not just any friends; I found an amazing friend in you. Once again, a very Happy Birthday to the beautiful and kind-hearted Pranitha! Okay, now come back and tell me if you liked it.",
